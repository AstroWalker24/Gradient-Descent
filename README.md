# ML-GradientDescent

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch. Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization technique used in machine learning and statistics to minimize a given function. This implementation serves as an educational resource for understanding how Gradient Descent works and how it can be applied to various optimization problems.

## Features
* Gradient Descent Algorithm: A step-by-step implementation of the gradient descent optimization technique.

* Customizable Parameters: Options to adjust learning rate, number of iterations, and initialization parameters.

* Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive explanations and comments within the code to facilitate learning and understanding.

* Performance Visualization: Plotting the cost function over iterations to visualize the convergence of the algorithm.
